# Cargo configuration for AWS Lambda cross-compilation
# This file configures build settings for different target architectures

# x86_64 Linux target configuration (Intel/AMD processors)
# AWS Lambda's traditional runtime architecture - widely supported and compatible
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# Linker configuration for cross-compilation to x86_64 Linux
# When building on macOS or other non-Linux systems, this ensures proper linking
# Note: Requires cross-compilation toolchain to be installed
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"

# ARM64 Linux target configuration (Graviton processors)
# AWS Lambda Graviton provides better price-performance than x86_64
# This target is optional but recommended for cost optimization

# Linker configuration for cross-compilation to ARM64 Linux
# When building on non-ARM systems, this ensures proper linking for Graviton
# Note: Requires cross-compilation toolchain to be installed
